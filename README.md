# 💳 Simple ATM Simulator (C++)

A **console-based ATM Simulator** written in **C++**.  
This project mimics the basic functionalities of a real ATM machine such as **user authentication, balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and exit**. Perfect for beginners to practice C++ programming and understand object-oriented concepts.

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 **User Authentication** – Simple login system to simulate card & PIN verification.  
- 💰 **Balance Inquiry** – Check current account balance.  
- 💵 **Cash Deposit** – Add money to your account.  
- 🏧 **Cash Withdrawal** – Withdraw money with balance checks.  
- ❌ **Exit** – Safely exit the ATM simulation.  
- 📄 **Simple & Clean Console UI** – Easy-to-use interface in the terminal.
